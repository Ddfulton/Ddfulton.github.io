  </header>

  <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
    <p>After six months with Azure OpenAI&rsquo;s Whisper API, a major call center needed a better solution. They were processing hundreds of thousands of minutes of audio per day, and costs were climbing. More importantly, they needed speaker diarization—something the OpenAI API simply didn&rsquo;t offer.</p>
<p>Without diarization, they couldn&rsquo;t answer critical performance management questions: What percentage of agents proactively offered a specific solution? What percentage mentioned key product features? Which agents needed coaching on particular topics? These insights were locked behind the technical limitation of not knowing <em>who</em> said <em>what</em>.</p>
<p>This is the story of how they moved to Carolina Cloud and cut their transcription costs by over 90% in absolute terms while gaining the critical features they couldn&rsquo;t get before.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup-a-good-start-with-growing-pains">The Setup: A Good Start with Growing Pains</h2>
<p>Our customer came to us in an enviable position. Their call center infrastructure was already well-organized: audio files in <code>.wav</code> format were automatically dumped to a shared drive in a clean file structure. The raw materials were there and ready to process.</p>
<p>They also had a substantial enterprise agreement with Azure, which gave them immediate access to OpenAI&rsquo;s Whisper API through the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. For their MVP phase, this was perfect—clean, simple, and at $0.006 per minute of audio, seemingly affordable.</p>
<p>But as their call volume grew, the cracks began to show.</p>
<h2 id="the-breaking-point-when-mvp-meets-reality">The Breaking Point: When MVP Meets Reality</h2>
<p>The problems started stacking up:</p>
<p><strong>Rate limits hit at exactly the wrong time.</strong> The team tried Python&rsquo;s <code>threading</code> to fire multiple requests simultaneously, but the bottleneck was on Azure&rsquo;s backend—no amount of client-side parallelization could help. They couldn&rsquo;t simply subscribe directly to OpenAI due to onerous legal and compliance requirements that would take months to navigate. Carolina Cloud eliminated this concern entirely—we operate in a SOC2 and HIPAA-compliant Tier 3 data center in North Carolina (huge shoutout to Tier.Net for helping us achieve this).</p>
<p><strong>Transcription slowed during peak demand.</strong> When call volume spiked, processing times dragged. The API&rsquo;s orchestration overhead meant significant delays before audio files even reached a Microsoft GPU.</p>
<p><strong>The cost curve was unsustainable.</strong> Here&rsquo;s where the math got scary: in their industry, call volume could increase tenfold overnight based on interest rate fluctuations. With per-minute pricing, costs would 10x exactly when they needed transcription the most.</p>
<p><strong>No speaker diarization.</strong> This was the real dealbreaker. For performance management and quality assurance, they needed to analyze agent behavior: What percentage of agents mentioned the return policy? What percentage proactively offered the premium service? Which agents needed coaching on objection handling? Without knowing <em>who</em> was saying <em>what</em> in each call, these critical metrics were impossible to calculate. The OpenAI API couldn&rsquo;t do it, and their locked-in Azure relationship made it difficult to adopt third-party diarization services quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Death by a thousand ingress fees.</strong> Microsoft charges for data ingress from on-premises to Azure, and these fees added up daily—seemingly trivial until you&rsquo;re transcribing thousands of calls per day.</p>
<p>The team had Linux and Python expertise, but they&rsquo;d never worked with NVIDIA MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) technology. They needed a partner who could help them level up.</p>
<h2 id="enter-carolina-cloud-testing-the-waters">Enter Carolina Cloud: Testing the Waters</h2>
<p>When the customer approached us, we knew the solution would involve NVIDIA GPUs and local processing. But first, we needed to prove the economics worked.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop">nvtop</a> to monitor GPU utilization, we noticed that each transcription job used less than 1/7th of the full H100&rsquo;s capacity. This confirmed that MIG partitioning was the right approach—by splitting the GPU into seven instances, we could genuinely process seven calls in parallel without any instance becoming a bottleneck. The result: true 7x performance improvement.</p>
<p>We set them up with a single NVIDIA H100 server configured with MIG to create seven isolated GPU instances—seven parallel &ldquo;listeners&rdquo; that could process calls simultaneously. Each listener ran in its own Docker container with dedicated access to 1/7th of the H100&rsquo;s GPU resources. Every container ran Whisper locally with <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/asr/speaker_diarization/intro.html">NVIDIA NeMo for speaker diarization</a>.</p>
<p>The results were immediate and dramatic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing speed increased 7x</strong> compared to API calls during peak times—each MIG instance handling transcription in parallel</li>
<li><strong>Zero rate limiting</strong>—all seven instances could run at full capacity simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>Built-in diarization</strong> with NeMo&rsquo;s state-of-the-art models</li>
<li><strong>Predictable, fixed costs</strong> regardless of volume spikes</li>
<li><strong>Zero ingress fees</strong>—no charges for transferring data from on-premises</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-the-switch">Making the Switch</h2>
<p>The transition took less than a week. We helped them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the H100 server with MIG configured for optimal transcription workloads</li>
<li>Deploy Docker containers for each MIG instance running Whisper with NVIDIA NeMo diarization</li>
<li>Integrate with their existing file structure and workflow</li>
<li>Train their team on managing the MIG instances and Docker containers</li>
</ol>
<p>The team went from zero MIG experience to confidently managing their own GPU infrastructure. Today, they process hundreds of thousands of call minutes daily, with speaker attribution, at a fraction of their previous cost.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Sometimes the cloud isn&rsquo;t the answer. Sometimes you need dedicated hardware, expert support, and a partner who understands your specific needs.</p>
<p>An <strong>over 90% absolute cost reduction</strong> (48x cheaper per minute) isn&rsquo;t just a number—at this scale, the savings add up quickly. But for this call center, moving from Azure OpenAI&rsquo;s API to Carolina Cloud meant more than just cost savings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential features unlocked</strong>: Speaker diarization with NeMo enabled the performance metrics they desperately needed</li>
<li><strong>True 7x performance improvement</strong>: Seven parallel MIG instances processing calls simultaneously with dedicated GPU resources</li>
<li><strong>Predictable, fixed costs</strong>: No more worrying about 10x cost spikes during volume surges</li>
<li><strong>Freedom from constraints</strong>: No rate limits, no vendor lock-in, all processing on their infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Room to scale</strong>: Current setup handles peak volumes comfortably with capacity to spare</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-note-on-this-case-study">A Note on This Case Study</h3>
<p>We want to be transparent: the Whisper API has evolved significantly since this migration, with improved rate limits and performance. There are also now several excellent third-party services offering diarization capabilities.</p>
<p>This was one of our more hands-on projects—it required a few smart engineers on our client&rsquo;s side who were willing to roll up their sleeves and work closely with us. We also offer simple on-demand GPU rentals for teams that just need infrastructure without the white-glove service. Different needs, different solutions.</p>
<p>But for this client, the hands-on approach was exactly what made this a win-win. Their company had been looking to build more in-house technical capabilities anyway, and this project gave their team the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with GPU infrastructure, MIG partitioning, and containerized ML workloads. They weren&rsquo;t just cutting costs; they were investing in their team&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>This kind of personal investment in customer success—where we&rsquo;re not just providing infrastructure but actively partnering to upskill their team—is what sets Carolina Cloud apart. We&rsquo;re not for everyone, but for teams that want to own their infrastructure and build deep technical capabilities, we&rsquo;re the right partner.</p>
