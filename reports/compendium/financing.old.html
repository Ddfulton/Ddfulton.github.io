                                    "At the core of everything we do is the focus to give our consumers the choice and control of how to shop and manage their personal finances in a sustainable way. " - Klarna 2020 Annual Financial Report</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna is a leading provider of payment and financing services in the retail sector. Their core service is to assume stores' claims for payments and handle customer payments, thus eliminating the financial risks for both the seller and buyer. Truly disruptive business model that is redefining the e-commerce experience for millions of consumers and global retailers. They grow alongside the increasing e-commerce and online payment shift. They are partnered with 250,000 Retailers and have 1.1bn USD in net operating income. In 2020 Klarna's volume increased 46% (53bn USD) with 87m active users.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The Klarna app directs users to merchants 22M monthly. From a Klarna survey, customers enjoy being able to spread cost, security of the application, and "try before you buy".</p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2017, their banking license was approved and they are now Klarna Bank AB. In 2020, they launched savings account capabilities in Sweden and within 12 weeks 12bn SEK had been deposited. In June 2020, they opened Klarna Bank AB German Branch. Klarna Open Banking is a scalable banking platform with a sleek user experience offered via API in Europe and UK. Offerings include AIS (Account Information Services), PIS (Payment Initiation Services), and Account Insights. Klarna Open Banking has been offered to 6,000 banks with 80m users since inception.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna earns revenue through merchant fees (57% increase 2020), commision income (47% inc 2020), and interest income (17% inc 2020). They have CET1 of 29.5% - a very stable percentage.
                                    Per the 2020 Annual Financial Report, Klarna plans to grow through market expansion, developing non-credit and affiliate services, enhancing current offerings, and growing savings accounts. Their ultimate goal is to create an integrated banking experience with a platform for driving sustained preference and growth.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna has an ambitious goal backed by strong investors. They plan to be essential to all banks, and gaining a banking license was a big win. Their core financing/payments business is strong and they are creating a strong following through Vibe rewards program, “smoooth” user flow, and KlarnaSense (program to encourage personal financial stability). Small no-interest financing is a popular market with Klarna facing strong competitors in Affirm and Paypal. Klarna is structure in 300 individual units, each with a separate goal and budget. This is great for innovation, but the siloed approach could get in the way of their ultimate goal as an “integrated banking experience”. The cost of expansion is great, and in order to see results they need to vastly grow their banking arm. While Klarna Banking AB is compatible with all of the EU, UK, and partially the US, it is only active in Sweden and Germany. The success/failure in these two countries is essential in their continued growth. </p>

                                    OakNorth is a UK bank targeting small and medium-sized companies providing business and property loans. Serving the "Missing Middle” customers that are often overlooked and won’t find a loan elsewhere (est. 1.2T USD opportunity). These clients are micro-businesses with a few million in assets, but commercial banks treat them like retail customers. OakNorth looks for high growth, positive multiplier effect for job creation and GDP growth in need of fast, flexible debt finance. They were valued at $2.8bn in 2019 when SoftBank invested 440m. However, in Nov 2020 Indiabulls Housing sold 7.7% stake ($145M) at a 25% discount at current valuation, reducing OakNorth;s worth to $2B.</p>
                                <p>
                                    OakNorth provides a credit decision technology, ON Credit Intelligence Suite, that uses forward-looking assessment of industry benchmarks specific to 262 proprietary sub-sectors, scenario analysis of said sectors, businesses’ growth potential and alternative forms of collateral. Dubbed "Credit Science", they utilize robust data sets in their credit algorithm, OakNorth's "secret sauce" has funded 5b pounds since inception in 2015 with 1.6B repaid.</p>
                                <p>
                                    They have 170,000 savings account customers, increasing 16% in 2020 from 1.98b to 2.3b pounds. In 202 they launched a fixed term deposit for self-invested personal pension.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While OakNorth loans only to UK businesses, they license their technology to banks globally (PNC, SMBC, NIBC). Surprisingly, they use a 'glass box' approach, allowing licensees to see how the algorithm works and allow them to alter it for stress tests.</p>
                                <p>
                                    OakNorth has a RORE of 24%, efficiency ratio of 27% and Net Promoter score of 80 (compared to many banks with a score of 42). They saw 44% growth from 2019 to 2020 in profit before taxes. Their NOI increased 34% to 144.1M and net interest margin increased to 6.2% from 5.9%.</p>
                                <p>
                                    ON is forward thinking and has a robust risk management program. They created the CVR Framework (COVID Vulnerability Rating) to create stress tests and impact models for sub-sectors, keeping into account CLBILS and CBILS. They are net carbon zero, and are keeping a close eye on the impacts of climate change, economic impact, Brexit, and SME competition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OakNorth's loan business is limited, only reaching those in the UK. However, if they continue to license their technology globally, their business will continue to grow. There is an argument they are growing too fast, seeing profit immediately in their first year and growing exponentially YOY.

                                    <p>On Aug. 1st, Square agreed to buy the Australian BNPL company Afterpay in a $29 billion all-stock deal. "The Afterpay deal is the largest acquisition Square has made by nearly two orders of magnitude, representing about 25% of Square's market cap and dwarfing Square's acquisitions of Weebly and Tidal, which had been the company's largest purchases," said Lisa Ellis, a MoffetNathanson analyst, in a report.</p>

                                    <p>Square takes on multiple roles in its own payment ecosystem. By strategically diversifying its portfolio, the company balances out the risks and diminishes the power of its existing and quite large competitors such as Google Wallet, Paypal-owned Venmo and Intuit (just to name a few).</p>

                                    N26 was launched as an online digital bank in 2013 offering digital mobile banking solutions. It offers personal and business bank accounts, debit card services, sub accounts, free automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals, foreign currency payment services, medical coverage, and insurance packages for work and travel. The company also provides biometric identifications, instant push notifications, and customer support services through chat and phone. It offers its services through mobile and web applications. The company was formerly known as Papayer GmbH. N26 GmbH was incorporated in 2013 and is based in Berlin, servicing over 7mn clients (as at January 2021) in 25 countries from eight global offices. It is regulated by the BaFin. N26 raised $470mn in its Series D funding round in 2019 at an implied valuation of $3.5bn. It raised a further $136mn at the same valuation in the first half of 2020. In total, N26 received €818.6mn over the course of its existence </p>
                                <p>N26 was one of the first Fintech’s in Germany offering its customers a whole new banking experience. The company has a very strong customer growth reaching 7mn+ clients in January 2021. Its main target group consists of millennials and young professionals. Keeping that in mind, the company was quick to leverage its monetization potential by forming integration partnership with, for instance, WeWork, Lime, Zalando and Uber, etc. Early on, the company focused on marketing, branding and a unique and identifiable design. The company also regularly adds new features to the offering, such as insurance and deposits.
                                </p>
                                <p>Due to its strong focus on customer acquisition and continued high investments, the company still has not made any profit yet. Although N26 is profitable per customer, the company as a whole is still loss-making (€110mn in 2020 and €217mn in 2019). A large chunk of their income comes from fees from payment transactions and accounts. </p>
                                <p>
                                    N26 processes billions of euros in transactions per month, and many customers pay by card, which is a sales driver. However, the company needs to have active clients, now only 30 percent use it as their primary bank and 70 percent still have a free account.</p>
                                <p>
                                    N26’s USP definitely lies in its user design and experience. It sources all software externally. Therefore, N26’s risk of being completely reliant on software providers, like Mambu, who provides their core banking platform to them, is particularly high.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Moreover, the risk of money laundering and cyber attacks is higher than for traditional banks. One of N26’s founders Valentin Stalf explained in an interview with Handelsblatt: "we are the only German bank that operates across borders in many countries and in some other countries there is a higher level of fraud than in Germany,". At the same time, N26 also has to do more in the fight against criminals. "This year we are investing 25 to 30 million euros in fraud prevention alone."</p>
                                <p>
                                    Being one of the best-known neo banks in Germany and one of the largest fintech start-ups, it might not be surprising that the company is especially targeted by fraudsters. In mid-August it became known that criminals allegedly opened and used more than 1,000 accounts with N26. Most were used in so-called fake shops or fraudulent Ebay accounts. </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, the financial regulator Bafin is considering restricting new business from N26, as the Handelsblatt recently reported. The authority is disgruntled that N26 has still not remedied serious deficiencies in the organization or in the fight against money laundering and other illegal transactions. </p>

                                <p>Alipay is a sub-sector of Ant Group headquartered in Hangzhou, China in 2014 by Jack Ma. Alipay is a "financial supermarket" for Chinese citizens, handling payments, loans, and investments. Consumers can purchase with Alipay in most stores and online. Banks, insurance agencies, and asset managers also use the app to lend, escrow services, sell mutual funds, and sell insurance. The data aggregated by Alipay is insurmountable to Ant and the greater Chinese economy. They advertise advanced encryption, risk management, and real time monitoring of payments.</p>

                                <p>Alipay has become a staple for almost all consumers in China. It is utilized by 1bn customers and 80mn merchants annually. Short term tourists (< 90 days) can use Alipay without foreign transaction fees. However, the US banned Alipay in response to tense foreign relations in 2019. In 2019-2020 fiscal year, there were $17tn in transactions, with $3.76bn in revenue in just the first half of 2020. This is more than Visa or Mastercard.</p>

                                <p>The lending platform boasts $300bn credit balance and $590bn in investments through the wealth management platform.</p>

                                <br><br>

                                <p>Ant was supposed to go public at YE 2020, but it was canceled when CEO Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators. His whereabouts are now unknown. The valuation at the time was $300bn, but has since been demoted by Fidelity to $144bn due to Chinese crackdown on homegrown technology companies and $2.7bn antitrust penalty.</p>

                                <p>In 2021, Chinese Central Bank and Chinese regulators have forced Ant to spinoff Alipay and Ant has to transition to a financial holding company that will curb profit. Regulators are also attempting to prevent Alipay from consuming customer data, which fuels Ant's greater bottom line.</p>

                                <p>Alipay has been able to increase fees at will due to its wide reach and is now engrained in everyday society. In many cases the government cannot even intervene. This market will only increase, personal investable assets projected to be $45.2tn by 2025. up 79% from 2019. Alipay had a monopoly over the Chinese market, but Paypal was allowed entrance in 2019. The Chinese government and regulators are set out to limit growth and power of tech firms. With the spinoff of Alipay and the transformation of Ant Group to a financial holding company, the future remains uncertain. Tense international relations are also cause for concern. </p>

                    <p>Wise provides cross-border money transfer services for personal and business customers in Europe, the United Kingdom, the Asia-Pacific, North America, and internationally. The company’s payments infrastructure comprise various products, including Wise Transfer to send money abroad; Wise Account to meet multi-currency banking needs for people; Wise Business, an account that provides business customers with international banking features; and Wise Platform that allows banks, including credit unions and financial institutions, and enterprise partners to integrate its payments network into their own mobile applications or online banking. It also offers online currency exchange services. Their business model is simply to pass on wholesale discounts to their customers. The company is able to do this by maintaining liquidity in all their supported currencies, executing forex trades in the biggest chunks possible.</p>

                   <p>The company was formerly known as 456 Newco plc and changed its name to Wise plc in June 2021. Wise plc was founded in 2010 and is based in London, the United Kingdom. What distinguishes them from others is that they have best in class customer support, UX and UI.</p>


                   <p>Their biggest risk is simply that they must hold so much cash, making them quite vulnerable to inflationary pressures (Fig 1). In second place comes the fact that they still lack a banking license, a problem that plagues most fintechs, and must store their cash with custodian banks. This makes them unable to lend and forces them to endure historically low (if not negative) interest.</p>

                   <br>
                   <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/img/wise_bs.png" width="600"/>

                   <br><br>

                   <p>They have around 10 million customers but have incredible room to grow as the vast majority of retail currency exchange volume is still owned by banks, who often charge extortionate fees. Transferwise adds true value by sharing part (but not too much-they are already profitable unlike many other Fintech darlings) of wholesale forex savings with its customers. Wise is a long-term winner in our view, with a first class user experience that all financial services should pay close attention to. At the very least it sure beats the hell out of travelers checks!</p>
