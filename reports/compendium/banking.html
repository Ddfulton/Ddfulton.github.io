                                    N26 was launched as an online digital bank in 2013 offering digital mobile banking solutions. It offers personal and business bank accounts, debit card services, sub accounts, free automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals, foreign currency payment services, medical coverage, and insurance packages for work and travel. The company also provides biometric identifications, instant push notifications, and customer support services through chat and phone. It offers its services through mobile and web applications. The company was formerly known as Papayer GmbH. N26 GmbH was incorporated in 2013 and is based in Berlin, servicing over 7M clients (as at January 2021) in 25 countries from eight global offices. It is regulated by the BaFin. N26 raised $470M in its Series D funding round in 2019 at an implied valuation of $3.5B. It raised a further $136M at the same valuation in the first half of 2020. In total, N26 received $923.4M over the course of its existence </p>
                                <p>N26 was one of the first Fintech’s in Germany offering its customers a whole new banking experience. The company has a very strong customer growth reaching 7M+ clients in January 2021. Its main target group consists of millennials and young professionals. Keeping that in mind, the company was quick to leverage its monetization potential by forming integration partnership with, for instance, WeWork, Lime, Zalando and Uber, etc. Early on, the company focused on marketing, branding and a unique and identifiable design. The company also regularly adds new features to the offering, such as insurance and deposits.
                                </p>
                                <p>Due to its strong focus on customer acquisition and continued high investments, the company still has not made any profit yet. Although N26 is profitable per customer, the company as a whole is still loss-making ($123M in 2020 and $244M in 2019). A large chunk of their income comes from fees from payment transactions and accounts. </p>

                                    N26 processes billions of euros in transactions per month, and many customers pay by card, which is a sales driver. However, the company needs to have active clients, now only 30% use it as their primary bank and 70% still have a free account.</p>
                                <p>
                                    N26’s USP lies in its user design and experience. It sources all software externally. Therefore, N26’s risk of being completely reliant on software providers, like Mambu, who provides their core banking platform to them, is particularly high.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Moreover, the risk of money laundering and cyber attacks is higher than for traditional banks. One of N26’s founders Valentin Stalf explained in an interview with Handelsblatt: "we are the only German bank that operates across borders in many countries and in some other countries there is a higher level of fraud than in Germany,". At the same time, N26 also has to do more in the fight against criminals. "This year we are investing 25 to €30M in fraud prevention alone."</p>
                                <p>
                                    Being one of the best-known neo banks in Germany and one of the largest fintech start-ups, it might not be surprising that the company is especially targeted by fraudsters. In mid-August it became known that criminals allegedly opened and used more than 1,000 accounts with N26. Most were used in so-called fake shops or fraudulent Ebay accounts. </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, the financial regulator Bafin is considering restricting new business from N26, as the Handelsblatt recently reported. The authority is disgruntled that N26 has still not remedied serious deficiencies in the organization or in the fight against money laundering and other illegal transactions. </p>

                                    Revolut – the financial super app - develops a mobile application that allows users to exchange currencies at interbank rates, send money through social networks, and spend with a multi-currency card. It also provides phone, medical insurance, and travel insurance. The company was incorporated in 2013 and is based in London, United Kingdom. Revolut was one of the first neobanks in Europe. It is particularly successful due to its low fees and slick and user-friendly experience both within its app and customer care. The company expanded quite rapidly and is now active in 35 countries employing between 1000-1500 people and serving 16mn private and 500,000 business clients. In July 2021, it has raised $800M and was valued at $33B in its Series E round of funding. The founders of Revolut also have a remarkable track record themselves – Nikolay Storonsky worked at Lehman Brothers before and Vlad Yatsenko is a former software developer at Credit Suisse. In the beginning of 2021, Revolut applied for a banking license in the UK, as it is not yet a full-fledged bank, but an e-money institution (fintech).</p>
                                <p>Revolut differentiates itself from other neobanks by its product offerings, that are constantly updated, added and adjusted. The focus of Revolut’s technology is to improve personalization, and to create new tools that aren’t as commoditized, such as budgeting tools and other financial management features. The company heavily invested into its technology stack – trying to build its own infrastructure and becoming a “super app” for users. However, Revolut is just like the other neobanks especially prone to cyberattacks and money laundering. In order to diminish the risk of money laundering and fraud, it recently invested heavily into machine learning that detects signs of fraud.</p>

                                <p> SolarisBank AG develops a banking platform and its main focus is to provide Banking-as-a-service. Its platform enables startups, fintechs, and established digital companies to create custom solutions for their unique financial needs. The company also provides various compliant payment services, including e-money issuing and escrow solutions; support services for account creation and maintenance, and transaction services, as well as deposit and credit business. Solarisbank does not operate in the B2C business itself but enables other providers to offer certain financial services to end customers. Their business is divided into four units: digital banking, lending, identity, digital assets. SolarisBank AG was incorporated in 2016, employs 400+ people and is based in Berlin, Germany. The company is still loss making  and had a cashburn of $31.320M in FY20 which was slightly higher than in the previous year. One of the reasons was the sharply increasing general administrative expenses. However, the company received funding again this summer of $214M. Deducting the purchase price for the takeover of the British challenger bank Contis of $112M it still has sufficient capital as a sort of buffer.

                                <p>One distinguishing feature of Solarisbank is their large total available market (TAM) which can be any potential Neobank. Also, it is active in not well established (yet) but growing, developing niches. Therefore, the competition is still not as fierce and customers tend to be sticky. The company had a strong contract and partner growth (23% and 39% respectively). Partners of Solarisbank include, for instance, OTTO Group, Amex Germany, Vivid Money, BP as well as Samsung Pay which was by far the largest. Samsung Pay entered the German market in cooperation with Visa (20M devices in Germany, Solarisbank receives a share of 0.2% interchange fees). Further, the bank has increased flexibility due to the combination of full banking license with API-based infrastructure.</p>
                                <p>A threat of Solarisbank is that their core banking system is provided by an external company, Pass Consulting. Also, open banksing / PSD2 is another threat that they should definitely consider.

                            Adyen N.V is a payment platform in Europe, North America, the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and internationally. The company’s platform integrates payments stack that include gateway, risk management, processing, issuing, acquiring, and settlement services. Adyen Issuing was launched in 2019 and enables merchants to provide virtual and physical cards to their customers which gives them the ability to issue cards across their various sales channels. Also, Adyen offers a back-end infrastructure for authorizing payments across merchants’ sales channels, as well as online, mobile, in-store, and APIs. The company’s platform services a range of merchants across various verticals, connecting them directly to Visa, Mastercard, and other payment methods and providing data insights. Adyen N.V. was incorporated in 2006 and is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The company now has more than 3,500+ clients and is listed on Euronext stock exchange.</p>
                        <p>
                            The companies’ revenues grew exponentially since its incorporation in 2006 –counting more than €3.641bn in FY2020 (+700%) and 500% profit growth in the last five years. Adyen processed a payment volume of over €159bn in 2018. It tremendously profited from rising e-commerce adoption. It pursues a single platform strategy and does not rely on any third-party system besides card networks such as Visa and Mastercard.
                            Not only Adyen recognized the enormous potential of payment processors – Paypal, Square and Stripe, as one of the largest players are increasingly attacking Adyen. One of the drawbacks of Adyen is that it’s 100% reliant on payment processing.
