                                <p>"At the core of everything we do is the focus to give our consumers the choice and control of how to shop and manage their personal finances in a sustainable way. " - Klarna 2020 Annual Financial Report</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna is a leading provider of payment and financing services in the retail sector. Their core service is to assume stores' claims for payments and handle customer payments, thus eliminating the financial risks for both the seller and buyer. Truly disruptive business model that is redefining the e-commerce experience for millions of consumers and global retailers. They grow alongside the increasing e-commerce and online payment shift. They are partnered with 250,000 Retailers and have $1.1B in net operating income. In 2020 Klarna's volume increased 46% ($53B) with 87M active users.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The Klarna app directs users to merchants 22M monthly. From a Klarna survey, customers enjoy being able to spread cost, security of the application, and "try before you buy".</p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2017, their banking license was approved and they are now Klarna Bank AB. In 2020, they launched savings account capabilities in Sweden and within 12 weeks 12B SEK had been deposited. In June 2020, they opened Klarna Bank AB German Branch. Klarna Open Banking is a scalable banking platform with a sleek user experience offered via API in Europe and UK. Offerings include AIS (Account Information Services), PIS (Payment Initiation Services), and Account Insights. Klarna Open Banking has been offered to 6,000 banks with 80M users since inception.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna earns revenue through merchant fees (57% increase in 2020), commision income (47% increase in 2020), and interest income (17% increase in 2020). They have CET1 of 29.5% - a very stable percentage.
                                    Per the 2020 Annual Financial Report, Klarna plans to grow through market expansion, developing non-credit and affiliate services, enhancing current offerings, and growing savings accounts. Their ultimate goal is to create an integrated banking experience with a platform for driving sustained preference and growth.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Klarna has an ambitious goal backed by strong investors. They plan to be essential to all banks, and gaining a banking license was a big win. Their core financing/payments business is strong and they are creating a strong following through Vibe rewards program, “smoooth” user flow, and KlarnaSense (program to encourage personal financial stability). Small no-interest financing is a popular market with Klarna facing strong competitors in Affirm and Paypal. Klarna is structure in 300 individual units, each with a separate goal and budget. This is great for innovation, but the siloed approach could get in the way of their ultimate goal as an “integrated banking experience”. The cost of expansion is great, and in order to see results they need to vastly grow their banking arm. While Klarna Banking AB is compatible with all of the EU, UK, and partially the US, it is only active in Sweden and Germany. The success/failure in these two countries is essential in their continued growth. </p>

                                <p> Affirm Holdings, Inc. (Affirm) is a digital and mobile-first commerce platform operating in the United States and Canada. The company had approx. 29,000 merchants (June 30, 2021) integrated on its platform, including several thousand integrated through its partnership with Shopify. The merchants range from small businesses to large corporations, direct-to-consumer brands, brick-and-mortar stores and companies with omni-channel presences spanning a diverse range of industries. Affirm typically earns a fee from its merchants when it helps to convert a sale and backs a payment.</p>

                                <p>Affirm’s platform comprises of three core elements: a point-of-sale payment solution for clients, merchant commerce solutions and a customer-focused app.</p>
                                <p>The client’s point-of-sale solutions allow customers to pay for their purchases over time in fixed amounts without deferred interest, hidden fees or penalties. On the interest bearing loans the company offers, it charges simple interest meaning that clients pay fixed amounts of interest that they agree to up front and the interest never compounds.</p>
                                <p>Affirms also offers merchants commerce solutions that help them accelerate their growth. The solutions empower merchants to increase demand by efficiently promoting and selling their products, optimize their customer acquisition strategies and drive incremental sales. The company’s flexible payment solution also help merchants to guarantee affordability for their customers, i.e., by providing a revenue accelerator while avoiding discounting and other expensive marketing and promotional channels. With Returnly, Affirm addresses the full shopping journey by enabling seamless return experiences that facilitate loyalty and satisfaction. The company is also backed by valuable product-level data and insights – information that merchants cannot easily get elsewhere and may be crucial for their strategies.</p>

                                <p>The company’s customer-focused app unlocks the full suite of Affirm’s products for a complete end-to-end customer experience. Clients can use the app to manage their payments, open a savings account and access a personalized marketplace. On this marketplace, customers can find products and purchase form Affirm’s partner merchants. It also allows merchants to provide tailored offers based on consumers’ spending patterns, including shopping habits and purchase intent. The company is also beginning to expand into buy-now-pay-later by offering Affirm Debit+.</p>

 -->                                <p>OakNorth is a UK bank targeting small and medium-sized companies providing business and property loans. Serving the "Missing Middle” customers that are often overlooked and won’t find a loan elsewhere (est. $1.2T opportunity). These clients are micro-businesses with a few million in assets, but commercial banks treat them like retail customers. OakNorth looks for high growth, positive multiplier effect for job creation and GDP growth in need of fast, flexible debt finance. They were valued at $2.8B in 2019 when SoftBank invested $440M. However, in Nov 2020 Indiabulls Housing sold 7.7% stake ($145M) at a 25% discount at current valuation, reducing OakNorth;s worth to $2B.</p>

                                    OakNorth provides a credit decision technology, ON Credit Intelligence Suite, that uses forward-looking assessment of industry benchmarks specific to 262 proprietary sub-sectors, scenario analysis of said sectors, businesses’ growth potential and alternative forms of collateral. Dubbed "Credit Science", they utilize robust data sets in their credit algorithm, OakNorth's "secret sauce" has funded ₤5B since inception in 2015 with ₤1.6B repaid.</p>
                                <p>
                                    They have 170,000 savings account customers, increasing 16% in 2020 from ₤1.98B to ₤2.3B. In 202 they launched a fixed term deposit for self-invested personal pension.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While OakNorth loans only to UK businesses, they license their technology to banks globally (PNC, SMBC, NIBC). Surprisingly, they use a 'glass box' approach, allowing licensees to see how the algorithm works and allow them to alter it for stress tests.</p>
                                <p>
                                    OakNorth has a RORE of 24%, efficiency ratio of 27% and Net Promoter score of 80 (compared to many banks with a score of 42). They saw 44% growth from 2019 to 2020 in profit before taxes. Their NOI increased 34% to 144.1M and net interest margin increased to 6.2% from 5.9%.</p>
                                <p>
                                    ON is forward thinking and has a robust risk management program. They created the CVR Framework (COVID Vulnerability Rating) to create stress tests and impact models for sub-sectors, keeping into account CLBILS and CBILS. They are net carbon zero, and are keeping a close eye on the impacts of climate change, economic impact, Brexit, and SME competition.
                                </p>

                                    OakNorth's loan business is limited, only reaching those in the UK. However, if they continue to license their technology globally, their business will continue to grow. There is an argument they are growing too fast, seeing profit immediately in their first year and growing exponentially YOY. In addition, their lending business is heavily reliant on property and construction. In order for sustained growth, OakNorth needs to diversify their bread and butter portfolio.</p>

                                <p>Alipay is a sub-sector of Ant Group headquartered in Hangzhou, China in 2014 by Jack Ma. Alipay is a "financial supermarket" for Chinese citizens, handling payments, loans, and investments. Consumers can purchase with Alipay in most stores and online. Banks, insurance agencies, and asset managers also use the app to lend, escrow services, sell mutual funds, and sell insurance. The data aggregated by Alipay is insurmountable to Ant and the greater Chinese economy. They advertise advanced encryption, risk management, and real time monitoring of payments.</p>

                                <p>Alipay has become a staple for almost all consumers in China. It is utilized by 1bn customers and 80M merchants annually. Short term tourists (< 90 days) can use Alipay without foreign transaction fees. However, the US banned Alipay in response to tense foreign relations in 2019. In 2019-2020 fiscal year, there were $17T in transactions, with $3.76B in revenue in just the first half of 2020. This is more than Visa or Mastercard.</p>

                                <p>The lending platform boasts $300bn credit balance and $590B in investments through the wealth management platform.</p>

                                <br><br>

                                <p>Ant was supposed to go public at YE 2020, but it was canceled when CEO Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators. His whereabouts are now unknown. The valuation at the time was $300B, but has since been demoted by Fidelity to $144B due to Chinese crackdown on homegrown technology companies and $2.7B antitrust penalty.</p>

                                <p>In 2021, Chinese Central Bank and Chinese regulators have forced Ant to spinoff Alipay and Ant has to transition to a financial holding company that will curb profit. Regulators are also attempting to prevent Alipay from consuming customer data, which fuels Ant's greater bottom line.</p>

                                <p>Alipay has been able to increase fees at will due to its wide reach and is now engrained in everyday society. In many cases the government cannot even intervene. This market will only increase, personal investable assets projected to be $45.2T by 2025. up 79% from 2019. Alipay had a monopoly over the Chinese market, but Paypal was allowed entrance in 2019. The Chinese government and regulators are set out to limit growth and power of tech firms. With the spinoff of Alipay and the transformation of Ant Group to a financial holding company, the future remains uncertain. Tense international relations are also cause for concern. </p>

				    <p>Wise provides cross-border money transfer services for personal and business customers in Europe, the United Kingdom, the Asia-Pacific, North America, and internationally. The company’s payments infrastructure comprise various products, including Wise Transfer to send money abroad; Wise Account to meet multi-currency banking needs for people; Wise Business, an account that provides business customers with international banking features; and Wise Platform that allows banks, including credit unions and financial institutions, and enterprise partners to integrate its payments network into their own mobile applications or online banking. It also offers online currency exchange services. Their business model is simply to pass on wholesale discounts to their customers. The company is able to do this by maintaining liquidity in all their supported currencies, executing forex trades in the biggest chunks possible.</p>

				   <p>The company was formerly known as 456 Newco plc and changed its name to Wise plc in June 2021. Wise plc was founded in 2010 and is based in London, the United Kingdom. What distinguishes them from others is that they have best in class customer support, UX and UI.</p>


				   <p>Their biggest risk is simply that they must hold so much cash, making them quite vulnerable to inflationary pressures (Fig 1). In second place comes the fact that they still lack a banking license, a problem that plagues most fintechs, and must store their cash with custodian banks. This makes them unable to lend and forces them to endure historically low (if not negative) interest.</p>

				   <br>
				   <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="assets/img/wise_bs.png" width="600"/>

				   <br><br>

				   <p>They have around 10 million customers but have incredible room to grow as the vast majority of retail currency exchange volume is still owned by banks, who often charge extortionate fees. Transferwise adds true value by sharing part (but not too much-they are already profitable unlike many other Fintech darlings) of wholesale forex savings with its customers. Wise is a long-term winner in our view, with a first class user experience that all financial services should pay close attention to. At the very least it sure beats the hell out of travelers checks!</p>
